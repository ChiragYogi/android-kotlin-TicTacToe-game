Build a Tic Tac Toe android app with kotlin support


# Overview

Here, I have build a Tic Tac Toe game app in Android Studio using Kotlin support.

    This project contain four activities:
        * The first activity is a splash screen that appears for 3000 milliseconds
        * The second activity is the main activity and where to select single or multiplayer mode
        * The third activity is single player mode to play against an algorithm
        * The fourth activity is the multiplayer mode for two players

    CLICK on Single Player Button -> to jump to the single player activity
    CLICK on Multiplayer Button -> to jump to the multiplayer activity
    CLICK on Add Tic Tac Toe ImageView -> it will amimate with a blink
    CLICK on the Zeph Games ImageView - > it will animate with a clockwise rotation
    
So its a fun game!! I worked on this project so as to get started to build real life app games and also to get
more attached with Android Development and kotlin language as well!!
Here, I also modified some of the animation styles according to my interest.
Hope to get more and more Android Development out of me in future!!
